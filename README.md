# Warwick_Econ_Coding_Group
this is the repo for the collection of learning resources of the coding group, in the University of Warwick Department of Economics.

## Python Tutorials

1. Our primary material is the online textbook by Arthur Turrell: https://aeturrell.github.io/coding-for-economists/intro.html. In the Chrstimas holidays the expected goal is to finish the "Getting Started" part to have a basic understanding of data structure, function and module.

2. Thomas Sargent's QuantEcon course in Python https://quantecon.org/lectures/. There are begining sections discussing Python concepts as well, following by introducing building blocks in econometrics&macroeconomics and series of macroeconomic structural models with code later.

3. To be more advanced in Python I strongly recommand my(Yaolang's) favourite Youtuber on this: https://www.youtube.com/@coreyms

## VSCode Tutorials

To get familiar to VSCode probably the most effective way is going through 

1. the official docs: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs 

2. the Youtube channel: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs


## Git Tutorials

There is plenty of similar tutorials for Git as long as your search in Youtube. The two channels mentioned above https://www.youtube.com/@coreyms and 
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs cover the Git as well and are ranked as one of the top in the search resulting list.
