With the collections of preference among our research students, we list below not only resources of programming languages, but also softwares that we think would facilitate our research once in the toolkit.

## Programming Language

### Python Tutorials

1. Our primary material is the online textbook by Arthur Turrell: https://aeturrell.github.io/coding-for-economists/intro.html. In the Chrstimas holidays the expected goal is to finish the "Getting Started" part to have a basic understanding of data structure, function and module.

2. Thomas Sargent's QuantEcon course in Python https://quantecon.org/lectures/. There are begining sections discussing Python concepts as well, following by introducing building blocks in econometrics&macroeconomics and series of macroeconomic structural models with code later.

3. To be more advanced in Python I strongly recommand my(Yaolang's) favourite Youtuber on this: https://www.youtube.com/@coreyms

### Matlab Tutorials (TBD)

### Julia Tutorials (TBD)

## Software Tutorials

## VSCode Tutorials

To get familiar to VSCode probably the most effective way is going through 

1. the official docs: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs 

2. the Youtube channel: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs

## Git Tutorials

There is plenty of similar tutorials for Git as long as your search in Youtube. The two channels mentioned above https://www.youtube.com/@coreyms and 
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs cover the Git as well and are ranked as one of the top in the search resulting list.

## Zotero

A good tool for literature management. Tutorial is available in its website & Youtube.

## Notion

A good tool for project management. Tutorial is available in its website & Youtube.
